**This project is defunct.** See "main" branch for project details. This branch is for the rewrite I made after I encountered a bug the first time I was unable to diagnose and fix. It actually renders for a couple seconds before erroring (how exciting!), but I abandoned this too. I don't remember why, but it was either just the general difficulty of it all, lack of interest, and/or the exact same thing again but with the rendering code.

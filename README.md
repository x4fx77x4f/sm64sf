# SM64SF
This is an **unofficial** port of Nintendo's *Super Mario 64* to [StarfallEx](https://github.com/thegrb93/StarfallEx). Most code has been translated manually. Currently, it is not playable or very complete.

## License
This project may contain code from [n64decomp/sm64](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64), [sm64-port](https://github.com/sm64-port/sm64-port), and [sm64ex](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex). These projects are all proprietary and originally derived from Nintendo's proprietary Super Mario 64.

While this project is without a doubt non-free, an effort has been made to reduce the amount of non-free content in this repository. Most non-code assets such as textures, models, and sounds are not included and must be extracted from an original ROM dump. Absolutely nothing in this repository is based on the leaked source code for Super Mario 64 (to my knowledge).

This project also includes *some* original code for which I would be willing to package separately under a free license if requested.
